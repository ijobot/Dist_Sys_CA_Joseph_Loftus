# J&J Brick Shippers Smart Offices Control System

This system controls the climate, lighting, and security for the offices of J&J Brick Shippers.

## Climate

The climate control system gets updated temperature and humidity readings every 30 minutes and then sets the internal climate controls to keep the office environment cool and comfortable.  It is an automated system that is triggered at 6am every morning and shuts off at 7pm.

## Lighting

The light controls are user initiated and can be accessed by any employee that is granted permission.  Individual lights can be set, as well as all lights in a given room.  Both brightness and color can be changed for each bulb.

## Security

The security system is accessible only by authorized security personel.  As employees enter the building, they are asked for their EmployeeNumber (which is given by swiping their ID card or tapping their ID fob) and subsequently asked to enter a 4-digit code that changes monthly.

## Discovery

The discovery service handles all other services and manages the overall system.

## This file will be updated regularly as the system changes.
